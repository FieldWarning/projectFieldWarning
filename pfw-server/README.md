### What?
This subdirectory is for the Nakama server handling our lobby, login and chat systems.

### How?
To start the server, install docker and run `docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml up` in this folder.

If using docker toolbox, you may need to set up port forwarding for the VM (by default you need port 7350): https://www.jhipster.tech/tips/020_tip_using_docker_containers_as_localhost_on_mac_and_windows.html
