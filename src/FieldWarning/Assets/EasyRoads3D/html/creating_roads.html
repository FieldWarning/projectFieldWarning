          <!-- [[serial]]//-->
          <p class="style1">By default markers cannot be accessed when road objects are in render mode (see just below). However when side objects have been built in render mode you will see that the marker objects appear again. By selecting a marker you can adjust the side object settings for this marker for any of the available side objects. Depending on the type of side object you will see the following properties:</p>
          <p class="style1"><strong>Selected Object:</strong> this is a combobox with all available side objects. Select the side object from the list you want to edit.</p>
          <p class="style1"><strong>Display Object:</strong> Toggle this on/off when you want to render the selected side object for the selected marker.</p>
          <p class="style1"><strong>Spline Node:</strong> Toggle this respectively on/off when you want to use this marker for the spline shape. The road scene in the demo project uses this feature for the &quot;Right Fence&quot; in the sharp corner. It cuts of a large part of the road shape. This allows you to create shapes that run independently from the actual road shape.</p>
          <p class="style1"><strong>Distance Sideways:</strong> This allows you to move the spline path for the selected side object away from the road shape. </p>

          <p class="style1">One of the main features of EasyRoads3D is adjusting the terrain to the shape of the road. Optionally you can also embed the shape of the road in the terrain splatmap with controls to expand or smoothen the shape.</p>

          <p class="style1">Clicking the Terrain tab from the marker toolbar will select the main road object first. In this case, click this tab again to activate the terrain rendering. </p>
          <p class="style1"><strong>NOTE:</strong> If you save a scene while an EasyRoads3D objects is in &quot;Render&quot; state and then close Unity, these objects will automatically switch back to edit mode after reopening the scene. This is to make sure the EasyRoads3D object is correctly initialized on startup and also to ensure that the original terrain data is preserved. It is therefor recommended to save your scenes with all EasyRoads3D objects in edit mode.</p>
          <p class="style1">After leveling is finished the following properties will appear in the Inspector Panel:</p>
          <p class="style21">ROAD GEOMETRY PROPERTIES<a name="road" id="road"></a></p>
          <p class="style1"><strong>Render:</strong> When this property is toggled on, terrain matching road geometry will be created. </p>
          <p class="style1"><strong>Material <span class="style21">(Full version &amp; Pro only)</span>:</strong> This will display the current road texture. Click on the texture to open the Road Texture Window. This will display all available road textures in the folder: /Assets/EasyRoads3D/Textures/Road Textures. You can add your own textures in this folder if you like to use this system. Below each texture you will see the supported shaders for this texture. Currently supported shaders are: Diffuse, Bumped Diffuse and Bumped Specular. The name convention is: texturename_d for the diffuse texture and texturename_b for the bumped texture. When the window opens the specific folder will be scanned and matching materials will be added to the combobox accordingly.</p>
          <p class="style1">The folder /Assets/EasyRoads3D/Shaders/ contains 6 different depth offset shaders to make sure the road is rendered on top of the terrain. When using a low Field of View on the camera you may still encounter some z-fighting. In this case open the respective shader and tweak the two Offset factor and unit parameters (just below LOD) further downwards.</p>
          <p class="style1"><strong>NOTE:</strong> Currently all road objects in a project use the same material. Changing the material on one of them will change the material on all other road objects. In the next release this will be handled per road object individually. Meanwhile you can manually add  materials if you like to use different materials per road.</p>
          <p class="style1"><strong>Road Segments <span class="style21"> (Full version &amp; Pro only)</span>:<a name="roadsegments"></a></strong> The number of segments over the width of the road. When this number is larger then 1 you will see the following new properties:</p>

          <p class="style1"><span class="style81">Save Geometry <span class="style21"> (Full version &amp; Pro only)</span>. </span>This will create a .obj file of the road geometry with the name of the road object  saved in the folder project/EasyRoads3D/[roadname]/.</p>
          <p class="style1"><strong>NOTE:</strong> When exporting the terrain the geometry  will match the position of the resolution slider! </p>
          <p class="style1"><strong>NOTE:</strong> The road object created by EasyRoads3D includes uv2 coordinates matching the terrain boundaries. This will allow you to use the terrain lightmap on the road. Simply choose a lightmapped shader for the road material and drag the terrain lightmap in the lightmap slot of this shader.</p>

You can choose between the standard &quot;Diffuse&quot; and &quot;Transparent&quot; shader. The advantage of the standard &quot;Diffuse&quot; shader is that the road and surface geometry is clearly visible on top of the terrain in hilly areas. The advantage of the &quot;Transparent&quot; shader is that you can control the opacity of the road surfaces with the &quot;Surface Opacity&quot; slider that will appear when this option is selected. This will make it easy to accurately draw road shapes when using a road map overlay texture as the terrain texture. The roads on the map will be clearly visible through the road surfaces.</li>
            <li class="style1"><strong>Surface Opacity.</strong> This controls the transparency of the road surfaces and is especially useful when you use map overlays. Simply lower the opacity level so roads ont the map are clearly visible. This will make it easier to position the road markers.</li>
            <li class="style1"><span class="style81">Enable Debugging. </span>Check this when you are experiencing issues when using EasyRoads3D. It will write debug info to the console which will help us to solve problems. </li>
            <li class="style1"><strong>Road Priority.</strong> Use this to set the priority for this road. When intersecting with other roads the intersection will first use the default crossing settings. Roads with an higher priority will keep their original shape at the crosspoint. Afterwards road priority can be tweaked for each crossing individually.</li>
            <li class="style1"><strong>Road width.</strong> This is the width used for road geometry. </li>
            <li class="style1"><strong>Road indent.</strong> The part outside the road that will have the same height level as the road. The value of this parameter will always be bigger then the distance between 2 terrain points to avoid the terrain popping through the road geometry, <a href="#indents" class="link">more info</a>.</li>
            <li class="style1"><strong>Raise markers (cm).</strong> When adding a road marker the y position of the marker will match the y position of the terrain at the specific point. This property will automatically raise or lower the marker position according the entered value. This is a simple but effective feature to add focus and detail to the road and near surrounding. Set it before adding markers! </li>
            <li class="style1"><strong>Force Y position.<a name="forceY"></a></strong>This is a useful feature when creating shapes with consistent y position changes, like rivers. When checked you will be able to assign a value. This value represents the y change per meter. When you add markers, the new marker will inherit the y position of the previous marker + this value * the distance between the markers.</li>
            <li class="style1"> <strong>Surrounding.</strong> Distance between the road and the terrain used for smooth transitions</li>
            <li class="style1"><strong>Closed Track</strong>. This will stitch  the start and end of the road together  and is useful for creating race tracks.</li>
            <li class="style1"><strong>Material.</strong> The material and texture for this road. Clicking the road texture will open the EasyRoads3D road materials window. The road textures are read from the folder /Assets/EasyRoads3D/Textures/Road Textures. Drop you own road textures in this folder. <span style="padding-top:5px;padding-bottom:5px">Alternatively you can of course swap  the Material attached to the Mesh Renderer of the specific road with your own road material once you are finished with the roads.</span></li>
            <li class="style1"><strong>Geometry Resolution.</strong> This controls the geometry resolution of the road surfaces. 1 represents the highest resolution towards 5 representing the lowest resolution level. It is recommended to use the lowest level (5)  while creating the road as it will improve performance although it may lead to<a href="#indents" class="link"> less accurate</a> results. Just make sure to set it at level 1 when testing the terrain leveling. Level 1 will always automatically be used when building the terrain and road geometry.</li>
            <li class="style1"><strong>Update Vegetation.</strong> When toggled on all tree and detail objects near the road will be removed. For both tree objects and detail objects individually you can specify the distance to the road within these objects will be removed. Depending on the number of tree and especially detail objects in the scene this process can take up some time. You may choose too disable this feature during testing the road and terrain leveling to speed up rendering the terrain.</li>
            <li class="style1"><strong>Auto Create Side Objects.</strong> When toggled on, active side objects will be automatically generated immdeiately after deforming the terrain.</li>
            <li><strong>Active Side Objects <span class="style21"> (Full version &amp; Pro only)</span>.</strong> Here all available side objects will be listed. You can toggle on / off side objects for this particular EasyRoads3D object. This will make it much easier to control your scene and manage side object settings per marker</li>
          </ol>
          <p class="style1"><span class="style21">NOTE:</span> EasyRoads3D uses layers 29, 30 and 31. Make sure other game objects in the scene are not on one of these layers to avoid unexpected behaviour! </p>

<p class="style21">Customized Road Shape to Terrain Splatmap<a name="roadsplatmap" id="splatmap2"></a></p>
<p class="style1">The road shape is saved in the folder [your project]/EasyRoads3D/[Road Object Name]/roadSplatMap.png</p>
<p class="style1">You can open this in your paint program to customize the splatmap. To embed the customized shape in the terrain, select Main Menu &gt; To add it to the terrain select Main menu &gt; EasyRoads3D&gt; Restore &gt; Terrain Splatmap data. You will be asked if you would like to merge the terrain splatmap backups with a road splatmap. Click yes and select the customized texture.</p>
<p class="style1"><strong>NOTE:</strong> Photoshop users, it is recommended to use &quot;Save for web...&quot; to save the png. If you save the image using &quot;Save as...&quot;, be sure to select the png format. Do not simply select the already existing file in your folder as this will probably NOT import well in Unity.</p>
<p><span class="style21">NOTE: </span><span class="style3">DO NOT</span> use the splatmap features if you are using more then 8 textures on your terrain!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="style21"><strong>Exporting Road Geometry</strong><a name="geo" id="geo"></a></p>
<p class="style1">The road  geometry exported from EasyRoads3D contains  vertex info, face info and one set of UV coordinates. You will have to apply normal info in your modeling application. If you exported the geometry with terrain lightmap support you will see 4 corner faces. Select all road faces and corner faces and use a planar type of uvmapping on the second channel. Save or export to .fbx. In Unity make sure that the import setting for size is 1. Choose a lightmap supported shader on your road asset and drag the terrain lightmap to the shaders lightmap slot. Drag the asset to your scene go to the EasyRoads3D menu and select &quot;Position Road&quot;, browse to the EasyRoads3D terrain export file and select it. The road will be positioned correctly. </p>
<p class="style1">Depending on your modeling application and/or the export settings you used to export the road, it could be that you have to rotate the object on 1 or more axis. The &quot;Position Road&quot; editor script has some commented code in it that can take care of this automatically once you figured out the correct settings for your case. Just uncomment the lines and fill in the correct values. </p>
