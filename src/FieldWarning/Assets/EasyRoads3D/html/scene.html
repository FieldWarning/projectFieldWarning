<p class="style1">After <a href="toolbar.html#addroad" class="link">adding a road</a> or selecting a marker (blue sphere handle) of an existsting road the road properties are displayed:</p>
<p class="style21"><img src="../images/roadproperties.jpg" width="412" height="1750"></p>
<p class="style1"><br>
  <span class="header2"><a name="lockedObject" id="addmarkers10"></a></span></p>
<p class="style21">Locked Objects</p>
<p class="style1">At the top right next to the road name you see a lock. You can use this to lock all the road settings. Togther with the &quot;Exclude Locked Objects&quot; option in <a href="general_settings.html#sceneSettings" class="link">Scene Settings</a>, this can also be used to hide the road handles in Scene View.</p>
<p class="style1">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="style1"><strong>Road Object Properties</strong><span class="header2"><a name="roadProperties" id="addmarkers5"></a></span></p>
<ul>
  <li><span class="propertyStyle">Road Name:</span> The name of the road</li>
  <li><span class="propertyStyle">Road Width:</span> The width of the road</li>
  <li><span class="propertyStyle">Sub Segments <strong class="propertyStyle">[Pro]</strong>:</span> This can be used to subdivide the road mesh for more detail. Note that this is not supported yet on dynamic crossings.</li>
  <li><span class="propertyStyle">Resolution:</span> the geometry resolution in meters</li>
  <li><strong class="propertyStyle">Angle Threshold [Pro]:</strong> This can be used to optimize the road geometry while still maintaining detail in bends. Try values around 5 and increase the road resolution to 10 or 20. The vertex / triangle count will drop significantly. In general it is not recommended to use a lower Angle Threshold than 4 or 5 unless you are after high definition.</li>
  <li><span class="propertyStyle">Road Smoothness <strong class="propertyStyle">[Pro]</strong>:</span> <br>
    <span class="propertyStyle">Bumpiness Y Offset:</span> The smoothness level of the road controllable through Min Max values<br>
    <span class="propertyStyle">Bumpiness Distance:</span> The distance controlable through Min Max values<br>
    <span class="propertyStyle">Random Tilting Angles:</span> Adds additional tilting to the road controllable through Min Max values<br>
    <span class="propertyStyle">Tilting Distance:</span> The distance over which the tilting takes place. </li>
  <li><span class="propertyStyle">Follow terrain Contours <strong class="propertyStyle">[Pro]</strong>:</span> The road will auto adjust to the terrain shape, this will greatly speed up the workflow as less markers will be required</li>
  <li><span class="propertyStyle">Contour Treshold <strong class="propertyStyle">[Pro]</strong>:</span> The accuracy. Use lower values to exactly match the terrain shape, use higher values for roads like motorways.</li>
  <li><span class="propertyStyle">Road Material:</span> the material assigned to this road. The dropdown lists all materials in /EasyRoads3D/Resources/Materials/Roads and can be used to quickly assign another material. It is recommend though to work with road types and apply the material changes to the road type.</li>
  <li><span class="propertyStyle">UV Tiling:</span> This controls the tile size of the used road texture.</li>
  <li><span class="propertyStyle">Additional UV data: </span>Additionally uv data matching the terrain boundingbox or uv data tiled on a specified distance can be generated in UV channel 4.</li>
  <li><span class="propertyStyle">Flip Road Texture / UVs: </span>This will swap the uv coordinates of the road. By default texturing of opposite roads on a connection will match regardless how they are connected to the crossing. If you do not want that for specific roads, you can change that by flipping the road texture of a road. This option can also be useful for roads connected to custom connectors when the UVs look wrong or flipped.</li>
  <li><span class="propertyStyle">Flip Normals:</span> This can be useful for tracks generated through the custom prefab system. Soemtimes you want thw normals to point to the other direction like for tunnel / cave type of shapes.</li>
  <li><span class="propertyStyle"><a name="startEndDecals"></a>Start Decal: </span>The currently selected Decal at the start, this can be updated manually by selecting another deval from the dropdown. Decals can be used as a transition between road types at crossings or to add variation, cracks, road fixes. Decal prefabs can be added per road type in <a href="general_settings.html#startEndDecals" class="link">General Settings &gt; Road Types</a>.</li>
  <li><span class="propertyStyle">End Decal:</span> The currently selected Decal at the start, this can be updated manually by selecting another deval from the dropdown. Decals can be used as a transition between road types at crossings or to add variation, cracks, road fixes. Decal prefabs can be added per road type in <a href="general_settings.html#startEndDecals" class="link">General Settings &gt; Road Types</a>.</li>
  <li><span class="propertyStyle">Closed Track:</span> This will loop the road, ideal for generating race tracks</li>
  <li><span class="propertyStyle">Terrain Deformation: </span>This can be used to turn off terrain deformation for this particular road, for instance roads used as bridge segments.</li>
  <li><span class="propertyStyle">Cast Shadows</span>: Toggle this on when the object should cast shadows.</li>
  <li><span class="propertyStyle">Delete Object:</span> this will remove the object</li>
  <li><span class="propertyStyle">Select Object in Hierarchy:</span> This will select the actual road object. It doesn't really serve a purpose other then providing a quick way to actually select that road in the hierachy</li>
  <li><span class="propertyStyle">Duplicate Object:</span> This will copy the object which is useful if you need a range of similarly shaped objects.</li>
<!--  <li><span class="propertyStyle">Waypoint Distance:</span> The distance between waypoints generated through the below button</li>
  <li><span class="propertyStyle"><strong>Generate Waypoints:</strong></span> This will generate empty game objects on the marker positions as a child of the road object itself (easy accessible through the above button <strong>Select Road in Hierarchy</strong>). The generated waypoints can fore example be used for AI purposes. </li>-->

  <li><span class="propertyStyle">Left Indent Alignment:</span> This can be used to manipulate terrain deformation in hilly areas. <strong>Align with Road</strong> is the default option and generally you want to use this setting. The two other options are useful in hilly areas where you want to add more definition to the terrain near the road by faking terrain through meshes which can be done through the side objects system, specifically the <a href="side_objects.html#shapeObject" class="link">Shape Object</a> type. <strong>Align with the terrain</strong> will snap the indent values to the terrain height at that point. <strong>Align with surrounding position</strong> will set the indent position at the same height as the corresponding left surrounding position.</li>

<p class="header2">I Connector <span class="style21">[Pro]</span><a name="IConnector" id="addmarkers11"></a></p>
<p>The I Connector differs from other Connection prefabs in a way that it not a prefab physically available in the assets folder or in the Connection Prefabs tab, the 3rd tab from the left in the Inspector.</p>
<p>I Connectors are directly attached to any marker. If this is not the first or last marker of the selected road, the road will be split in two roads at the selected marker with the I Connector in between the two.</p>
<p>I Connectors can be used for:</p>
<p>1) Blending roads, for example asphalt roads and dirt tracks. </p>
<p>2) Using different materials on a specific road segment</p>
<p>3) Connecting non matching road types</p>
<p>4) Cut roads in pieces for occlusion culling or streaming sections.</p>

  <li><span class="propertyStyle">Material:</span> The material assigned to the road. This currently has no function.</li>
  <li><span class="propertyStyle">Connector Distance:</span> By default the IConnector will connect both roads. Setting a Connector Distance will make it possible to adapt road widths and / or blend different road types.</li>
  <li><span class="propertyStyle">Stretch Width:</span> This will adapt the width over the connection distance. Options are Lineair, exponentional and smooth. &quot;Strech to fit&quot; will auto auto set the stretch level to match width of the other road.</li>
  <li><span class="propertyStyle">Sub Division:</span> Stretching can result in zigzag type of texturing. The Sub Division level will be useful here. The higher the value the more the zig zag effect will be reduced.</li>
